#summary Diagnosing when your code gets slow, only when it gets slow.

In *hatch-core*, there is {{{ExceedsDurationMetricsLogger}}}.  Combining this with by request processing and thread-specific tracing will enable you to track why a set of code did not perform within the specified duration.  

{{{

   TimerStackUtil.setState(TraceState.BY_REQUEST);
   ....

   public void businessMethod() {
     TimerStackUtil.enableAndPush("businessMethod");
     ...
     TimerStackUtil.setThreadLocalMetricsLogger(new ExceedsDurationMetricsLogger(999));
     TimerStackUtil.pop("businessMethod");
   }
}}}

The above code will enable tracing for that method.  However, Hatch will only
dump the stack if the business method took 1 second or greater.  

This is supremely handy to diagnose contention issues at run time without having to log every single request.  

I should write more here.
