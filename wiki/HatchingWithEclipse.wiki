#summary A few quick tips for using Hatch within Eclipse.

= Introduction =

Having instrumented a few different classes, here are some tips that you may want to consider when adding Hatch with Eclipse.

I strongly recommend starting with the top-most or outer-most method in your system.  This is likely some business-sounding method like {{{performTrade}}}, {{{validateAccount}}} or {{{login}}}.  In my example, it's called {{{solveLUE}}}. 

I assume you've added the necessary artifacts to your build path at this point.

= Autocomplete Types =

Eclipse will guess at types based on the acronym you enter.  Enter "*TSU*" and hit *Ctrl-Space* to save yourself needless keystrokes.

= Depth First Navigation =

Using *Ctrl-Click* and *Alt-Left* you can navigate in and out of the methods.  If you're not used to using *Alt-Left* to navigate, this may take a few tries to perfect.

|| *Ctrl-Click* into a Method || Make Your Change || *Alt-Left* out of the Method ||

* Note: Depending multiple *Alt-Left*s may be needed to get back to the previous method.
